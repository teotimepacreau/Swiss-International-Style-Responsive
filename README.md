# Swiss International Style responsive adptation
Responsive and accessible International Typographic Style classical posters web adaptation. 

The style of design that originated in Switzerland in the 1940s and 50s (Anonymous Style, Swiss International) with famous fonts : Helvetica, Univers, Akzidenz Grotesk, leaded by fathers of Swiss graphic design :Josef Müller-Brockmann, Armin Hofmann, Ernst Keller. 

# About this project
I want to sharpen my CSS grid skills and discover the raster Swiss system. The Swiss Grid is “neutral,” universally appealing aesthetic, and ideal for conveying information clearly.

# Poster Directory
These are all the posters available to explore in this repo. More will (hopefully) be added soon.
